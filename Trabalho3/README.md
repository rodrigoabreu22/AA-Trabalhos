# Identifying Frequent Items in Data Streams

Project realized by Rodrigo Abreu, number 113626, for the curricular unit **Algoritmos Avançados** of **Mestrado de Engenharia Informática** in **Universidade de Aveiro**.

## Structure

- **assignment/** folder contains the project guidelines (`AA___Trabalho_3.pdf`).
- **out/** folder contains all the artifacts generated by the script:
  - `figures/`: PNG plots used in the report.
  - `tables/`: LaTeX table files (.tex).
  - `raw/`: Raw CSV data from the experiments.
  - `latex_snippets/`: LaTeX code snippets for including figures.
- **netflix_titles.csv** is the dataset used for the frequency analysis.
- **Trabalho3_113626.pdf** is the file containing the final project report.
- **trabalho3.py** is the main script containing the implementation of the algorithms (Exact, Fixed Probability, Misra-Gries), the experimental pipeline, and the generation of all analysis assets (plots and tables).
- **requirements.txt** lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have python installed (Python 3.x).

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Enter the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
``` 

4. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the main execution script. This will process the dataset, run the experiments for all algorithms, and generate the content in the out/ folder:
```bash
python3 trabalho3.py
```
> Note: You can check available arguments with python3 trabalho3.py --help

6. Check the out/ folder to see the generated results: 
- out/figures/ for the visualization plots.
- out/tables/ for the LaTeX tables referencing top items and performance metrics.

7. Complement this with reading the report in order to understand the study and the analysis better: [Trabalho3_113626.pdf](Trabalho3_113626.pdf)
